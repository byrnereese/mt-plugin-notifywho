**This version is a beta version**. Please do not use it in
production. Also, while some things have changed, most of
it should be familiar for users of NotifyWho v1. I will
get around to updating the documentation shortly if
you're confused.
    
Also please see TODO.txt for what is still to be done.

## INTRODUCTION ##

The NotifyWho?! plugin enables you to control exactly who should receive
entry, comment and TrackBack notifications for each blog.

You can configure the plugin to send them to:

* The Entry author (MT default)
* One or more arbitrary email addresses
* The blog's address book (i.e. notification list)
* Any of the above

For entry notifications, you can configure the plugin to send them automatically or to simply provide defaults for the Share entry screen.  Automatic notifications can be disabled on a per entry basis by toggling the link directly about the entry save/preview buttons.

# Requirements

* Movable Type 4.1 or higher
* A working email notification system
* Ability to install plugins
* Permission to configure a blog and its plugins
